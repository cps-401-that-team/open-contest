            problem statement to describe the problem, input that the program must process, and 
            output that the program must produce. The goal of solving the problem is to write a

            your code is automatically run against secret test data and judged based on the output
            it produces. Your code can recieve the following verdicts:
            <ul><li><i>Accepted</i>: Your code produced the correct output for all test cases.</li>
                <li><i>Wrong Answer</i>: Your code produced incorrect output for some test case.</li>

            """),
        FAQ("How does scoring work?", """Your score is determined by two factors: the number of problems 
            you solve and the number of penalty points you accrue. Contestants are ranked first on 
            problems solved and then on penalty points. A contestant who solves 5 problems will always
            rank higher than a contestant who solves 4 problems, but two contestants 
            who each solve 4 problems will be ranked against each other by penalty points.<br/><br/>
            Penalty points are determined by the time it takes you to solve the problems and the number 
            of incorrect submissions that you make. When you solve a problem, you accrue 1 penalty point 
            for each minute that has elapsed from the beginning of the contest and 20 penalty points 
            for each incorrect submission you made to that problem. For example, if you solve a problem 
            137 minutes into the contest after making 2 incorrect submissions, you will accrue 177 
            penalty points. You do not accrue penalty points for incorrect submissions to a problem 
            if you never solve that problem.<br/><br/>

            Jim will receive a total of 233 points, and Bob will receive a total of 204 points.
